Hey ok so I'm probably sleeping right now. If you want to figure out the
front-end API fetch stuff, here are some pointers.

1. if all goes well, it should just workâ„¢.
2. That's probably not going to happen so,
3. The actual fetching code is in `src/lib/api.js`. This is very basic fetch.
4. There is login code in `src/lib/auth.js`.
5. I also fetch the tracker data in `src/routes/me.svelte`, on line 17.

Good luck, have fun. I'll prob be back at 9am.
